# ü§ñ AI Interview Coach  
*A self-hosted, intelligent mock interview partner.*  

This project is an **interactive AI interview coach** designed to simulate realistic technical interviews. It generates **role-specific questions**, evaluates user responses, and provides **structured feedback** ‚Äî helping candidates prepare for interviews with a hands-on, conversational approach.  

The system combines a **locally-hosted LLM** with **workflow automation** for a scalable and flexible architecture.

## ‚ú® Key Features  

- üéØ **Role-Specific Questions**  
  Generate realistic interview questions tailored to roles like *Cloud Security, DevOps, or Software Engineering*.  

- üìù **Structured Feedback**  
  Get detailed analysis of your answers, covering *clarity, correctness, and conciseness*, along with scoring.  

- üîÑ **Interactive Mock Interview**  
  Works like a real interview loop ‚Äî new questions and follow-ups are asked dynamically.  

- üß© **Decoupled Architecture**  
  The AI logic (Flask + LLM) and workflow orchestration (n8n) are independent, making it **modular and scalable**.
